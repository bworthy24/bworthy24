Welcome to my domain!
I'm Brey'Aisa! A computer Science Major studying at John Carroll University.
This GitHub will be a mixture of my own personal projects as well as examples & projects created during my undergraduate years.
I have many interest in the world of technology. It all started with game development and eventually grew into a love for cybersecurity as well
My most common interest are between Cybersecurity and Web development. 
As of currently I am studying multiple languages but the two I use most are Java & Python.

I am always looking to learn & collaborate. Any opportunity to learn is an opportunity to me!
