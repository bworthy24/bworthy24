Welcome to my domain!
My name is Brey'Aisa but I go by Ash. I am a Triple Major studying Computer Science, Clinical & Counseling Psychology, and Women, Gender & Sexuality at JCU.
This GitHub is where eventually I will upload all my projects from my undergraduate years, any personal projects, and hopefully update often. I'm not that great at being active here as 
most of my personal experience comes from my job at Goddess Elite where I have designed and currently maintain their website and it's functionality.
I am always looking to learn & collaborate. Any opportunity to learn is an opportunity I have interest in taking, so please feel free to reach out!
